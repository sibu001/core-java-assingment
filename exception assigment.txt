Q1. What is an Exception in Java?
ANS-Exception is an event which may disrupt the normal flow of the program.
 
Q2. What is the super or base class of all exceptions in Java?
ANS- "Throwable" is a super class of all exception in java.
            
Q3. What is the super class for error and exception classes in Java?.
ANS-  "Throwable" is super class of error and exception in java.
          
Q4. What are the types of exceptions in Java API? 
ANS- types of exceptions are=
        (i) checked                             
       (ii)  unchecked            
       

Q5. Why does an exception occur in the program?
ANS- Exception occur in java due to many reasons such as-
         (i)  user has entered an invalid data.
         (ii) file that needs to be opened cannot be found.  
        
Q6. What is exception handling in Java?
ANS- Java Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as ClassNotFoundException, IOException, SQLException, RemoteException, etc.

Q7. What is exception handler in Java?
ANS-An exception handler is code that stipulates what a program will do when an anomalous event disrupts the normal flow of that program's instructions.

Q8. What is the advantage of using exception handling in Java? 
ANS- Advantage of exception handling are-
     1)  Separating Error Handling Code from "Regular" Code.
     2)  Propagating Errors  
     3)  Grouping Error Types 

Q9. Which of the following statements will throw an exception? (WAP)
       a. System.out.println(1/0);
       b. System.out.println(2.0/0);
ANS- (1/0) gives arthimatic exception
         (2.0/0) gives infinity

Q10. Which exception maybe thrown if the given two code blocks are executed?
      WAP
a.
public class Test
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
int[ ] list = new int[4];
System.out.println(list[4]);
  }
}
b.--------------------------------------------------------------
public class Test
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
int a = 20;
int b = 30;
int c = 10;
int x = (a * b)/(a - b + c);
System.out.println("Result: " +x);
  }
}
ANS- BLOCK A- it gives ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
         BLOCK B- it gives arthimatic exception because of 600/0

Q11.Explain the Java exception hierarchy.  
ANS-      object-------

13.How do we catch exceptions?   WAP         
14.What is throwing an exception in Java? WAP
15.What is catching an exception in Java? WAP
16.What will happen to exception object after exception handling is done?             
17. How will you handle the checked exception? WAP
             Alternatively, What are the different ways to handle checked exceptions?
