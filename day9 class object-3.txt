                                                                                                DAY 9
                                                                                    CLASS AND OBJECT-III

Q1. What are the three types of variables in Java?
ANS- Three type of variables in java is local,instance and static.

Q2. How many copies of a static variable are kept in the JVM.
ANS- JVM kept only single copy of variable .which is stored in non-heap memory and memory allocated to static variable during 
         class loading.

Q3. The requirement is to assign a unique id to each object of the id
       created. In the Employee class add a static variable “nextId” of type
       integer. Add a method that increments the “nextId” Now create two or
       more objects of Employee and print the value of the “id” for each of
       these objects. Write your observations in the JavaDoc of the class.
Q4. What is the other name given to static variables? Hint : Class
       variables?
ANS- Static variable also known as class variables.
Q5. Can we change the value of static variables in the instance methods
       of the class?
ANS- YES, we can change static variable from a non static method. But vice-versa is not possible.

6. What are the two ways to initialize a static variable. Write a class
    Hospital, it has an static field “status” which can have values
   “registered”, “verified” and “certified”. You have to make sure that
    when the new object is created it’s value should be initialized with
   “registered”.
ANS- 
7. In the above program, use enums for the “status” field.
8. To access static variables outside of the class from some other class
you need to use the name of the class like Math.PI etc. Write a
program to print the Math.PI and Math.E etc.
ANS-
